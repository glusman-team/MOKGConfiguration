      notes: 'The table contains the results of the correlation analysis of taxa that have at least one mbQTL or mbBTL at P<5x10-8 and the 207 phenotypes measured in the LLD cohort as described in (Zhernakova et al, Science, 2016) 3. MbTLtype: indication if the associated taxon has a mbQTL or mbBTL. Taxon: name of taxon. Phenotype: name of associated phenotype. SpearmanR: Spearman correlation between bacteria and phenotype. Pvalue: p-value for Spearman correlation. FDR: p-value adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.'

      notes: 'The table contains the results of the correlation analysis of taxa that have at least one quantitative or binary mbTL at p<5x10-8 and the 503 phenotypes measured in the FGFP cohort as described in Falony et al, Science, 2016 4. Mb-TLtype: indication if taxon was associated in binary or quantitative analysis. Taxon: name of taxon. Phenotype: name of associated phenotype. SpearmanR: Spearman correlation between bacteria and phenotype. Pvalue: p-value for Spearman correlation. FDR: p-value corrected for false discovery rate.'
